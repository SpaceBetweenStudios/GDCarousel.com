          The past few months‚Ä¶ years‚Ä¶ were rough for everyone. Take a ride on a carousel for a moment of whimsy while at
          the Game Developer Conference or just happen to be near the Moscone Center.

            <a href="https://seg.fyi/">John "Seg" Seggerson</a> is a former game developer and moved on to experience
            design and immersive entertainment. On Thursday March 21st, he will personally sponsor every ride of the LeRoy
            King Carousel on Thursday March 21st.

                  There is no other important goal than to give folks a moment of pure, uncomplicated fun.

                  As a member of <a href="https://semperexplorandum.com/" target="_blank">The Explorers Guild</a> Troupe
                  #001, Seg has a fond connection to the LeRoy Carousel with the annual Steeplechase exploration.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  Having seen so many friends deal with the layoffs along with his own personal experience of the game
                  industry, Seg felt adding some whimsy to an otherwise abysmal time is desperately needed. While it will
                  not solve the problems of the video game industry, taking some time to remember joy and happiness will
                  hopefully help manage the future of the industry.

          Who operates the carousel?
        </h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://creativity.org/" target="_blank">The Children's Creativity Museum</a> owns and operates the
          <a href="https://creativity.org/carousel/" target="_blank">LeRoy King Carousel</a>. The museum operates the
          carousel at it's own discretion.

      <div class="col">
        <h4>
          How accessible is the carousel?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Everyone deserves to ride with dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guests are able to transfer to either a figure or chariot (the fixed bench seats of a carousel) directly from
          their
          mobility assistance device using the carousal's assistance ramp. For more information, consult the
          carousal operator of your needs on the day of your ride.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guests may be any height to ride. Any person under the height requirement of 42 inches (106.5 cm) requires an
          adult chaperone.

      <div class="col">
        <h4>
          May I ride more than once?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Of course you can! You will need to exit and reenter the queue so that everyone can get a ride in.

        <h4>
          Is this run by a conference that's happening near by?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This project is not affiliated with any convention, conference, it's holding companies, etc. It's just some dude
          paying for free rides at a carousal and made a website to tell people.
